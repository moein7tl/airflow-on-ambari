<configuration supports_final="true">
    <!--
      The scheduler mounts the following secrets into your workers as they are launched by the
      scheduler. You may define as many secrets as needed and the kubernetes launcher will parse the
      defined secrets and mount them as secret environment variables in the launched workers.
      Secrets in this section are defined as follows
          <environment_variable_mount> = <kubernetes_secret_object>:<kubernetes_secret_key>

      For example if you wanted to mount a kubernetes secret key named `postgres_password` from the
      kubernetes secret object `airflow-secret` as the environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` into
      your workers you would follow the following format:
           POSTGRES_PASSWORD = airflow-secret:postgres_credentials

      Additionally you may override worker airflow settings with the AIRFLOW__<SECTION>__<KEY>
      formatting as supported by airflow normally.
